### <a id='review'></a> Review

Recall that last time we introduced the [de Bruijn Graph](http://www.homolog.us/Tutorials/index.php?p=2.1&s=1) and the
[Eulerian Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path). A de Bruijn Graph can be constructed from the
L-spectrum through
the following steps:


1. Add a vertex for each [(L-1)-mer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer) in the L-spectrum.

2. Add k edges between two (L-1)-mers if their overlap has length L-2 and
the corresponding L-mer that contains both appears k times in the L-spectrum.  

An Eulerian Path of a graph is the path that traverses each edge of the graph exactly once.
Note that the Eulerian algorithm can find an Eulerian path in linear time. Recall that the greedy algorithm would need to compute overlaps between reads. If done
naively this scales quadratically in the number of reads. We will discuss this in the coming
lectures.


Here we consider the Dense Read Model,
where we assume that a read starts at every base in the genome.
This gives us
the L-spectrum of the genome. From this, we build a de Bruijn graph as described
above. As discussed in the last lecture, every Eulerian path in the de Bruijn
graph corresponds to a genome consistent with the data.

In this lecture we will discuss the conditions for the uniqueness of the Eulerian path and hence of the reconstruction of the genome. We
will next see a modification of the de Bruijn graph algorithm so that it works on
arbitrary reads rather than the L-spectrum of the genome. We will evaluate its performance and
look at some refinements.


### Examples of de Bruijn <a id='examples'></a>

At the end of the last lecture, we stated the following theorem:

**Theorem** [[Ukkonen 1995]((http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397592901434)),
[Pevzner 1992](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01188582)]:
The necessary and sufficient condition for assembly from the L-spectrum of a genome is that
L - 1 > $$\ell_{interleaved}$$, the length of the longest interleaved repeat
of the genome.


We see this by a few examples here.

**Example 1, Interleaved repeats of length L-1:** Let $$x$$ and $$y$$ be two interleaved
repeats of length L-1 on the genome. Let us assume that the genome has no other
repeat of length L-2 or more.
We show the genome using the shorthand: $$\mathtt{a-x-b-y-c-x-d-y-e}$$.  
This is illustrated below.

	<div class="figcaption">\(x\) and \(y\) are interleaved repeats of length \(L-1\). We assume that
  the rest of the genome has no repeat of length L-2 or more.</div>
</div>


The de Bruijn graph from the L-spectrum of this genome is given by

<div class="fig figcenter fighighlight">
  <img src="/Spr2016/assets/lecture8/Figure2.png" width="75%">
	<div class="figcaption">The de Bruijn graph corresponding to the L-spectrum of this

  \(\mathtt{a-x-b-y-c-x-d-y-e}\) and \(\mathtt{a-x-d-y-c-x-b-y-e}\)</div>
</div>

We note that an Eulerian path on the graph would start from $$\mathtt{a - x}$$.
Then one can either leave $$\mathtt{x}$$ through $$\mathtt{b}$$ or $$\mathtt{d}$$
to get to $$\mathtt{y}$$. Any Eulerian path then has to take the path $$\mathtt{c}$$
to $$\mathtt{x}$$. Then we can take the path not taken from $$\mathtt{x}$$ last time to
get to $$\mathtt{y}$$. This gives us two genomes consistent
with the de Bruijn graph : $$\mathtt{a-x-b-y-c-x-d-y-e} \text{ and } \mathtt{a-x-d-y-c-x-b-y-e}\text{.}$$


**Example 2, Triple repeats of length L-1:** Let $$x$$ be triple
repeats of length L-1 on the genome. Let us assume that the genome has no other
repeat of length L-2 or more. The genome will be represented using the
shorthand: $$\mathtt{a-x-b-x-c-x-d}$$  
This is illustrated below.

<div class="fig figcenter fighighlight">
  <img src="/Spr2016/assets/lecture8/Figure3.png" width="90%">
	<div class="figcaption">\(x\) is a triple repeat of length \(L-1\). We assume that

  \(\mathtt{a-x-b-x-c-x-d}\) and \(\mathtt{a-x-c-y-b-x-d}\)</div>
</div>

We note that that an Eulerian path on the graph would start from $$\mathtt{a - x}$$.
Then one can either leave $$\mathtt{x}$$ through $$\mathtt{b}$$ or $$\mathtt{c}$$
to get back to $$\mathtt{x}$$. The path then leaves $$\mathtt{x}$$ using the other path out
to return a third time to $$\mathtt{x}$$. Finally, the path leaves $$\mathtt{x}$$ through
$$\mathtt{d}$$. This gives us two genomes consistent
with the de Bruijn graph: $$\mathtt{a-x-b-x-c-x-d} \text{ and } \mathtt{a-x-c-x-b-x-d.}$$


In both these examples we have that $$L-1= \ell_{\text{interleaved}}$$ , and thus
genome can not be assembled from the L-spectrum as stated in the necessary condition of the theorem. Next
let us look at examples where the L-spectrum can be used to assemble the genome
by the de Bruijn graph algorithm, giving some intuition why the condition is also sufficient.

**Example 3, Simple repeat of length L-1:**  Let $$x$$ be simple
repeats of length L-1 on the genome. Let us assume that the genome has no other
repeat of length L-2 or more. The genome will be represented using the
shorthand: $$\mathtt{a-x-b-x-c}.$$

	<div class="figcaption">\(x\) is a simple repeat of length \(L-1\). We assume that

</div>

The de Bruijn graph from L-spectrum of this genome is given by

  genome is shown above. The only Eulerian path  on the graph is
  \(\mathtt{a-x-b-x-c}\)</div>
</div>

It is easy to see that the only Eulerian path on this de Bruijn graph is the
one corresponding to $$\mathtt{a-x-b-x-c}.$$ Note that the greedy algorithm may have chosen the path $$\mathtt{a-x--c}.$$

**Example 4, Non-interleaved pair of repeats of length L-1:** Let $$x$$ and $$y$$ be two non-interleaved
repeats of length L-1 on the genome. Let us assume that the genome has no other
repeat of length L-2 or more.
We show the genome using the shorthand: $$\mathtt{a-x-b-y-c-y-d-x-e}$$.

 <div class="figcaption">\(x\) is a simple repeat of length \(L-1\). We assume that

	<div class="figcaption">The de Bruijn graph corresponding to the L-spectrum of this

  \(\mathtt{a-x-b-y-c-y-d-x-e}\)</div>
</div>

It is fairly easy to show that $$\mathtt{a-x-b-y-c-y-d-x-e \ \ }$$   is the only Eulerian
path in the de Bruijn graph.


### A practical algorithm based on the de Bruijn graph algorithm <a id='practical'></a>

We note that the de Bruijn graph algorithm would work if we had the L-spectrum of
a  genome and $$L-1 > \ell_{\text{interleaved}}$$. However the number of reads of
length $$L$$ necessary to get the L-spectrum would be astronomical even for
modest genome sizes and large read lengths.

To get a more practical version of the de Bruijn graph algorithm, we have to go
through a detour. We basically try to get the k-spectrum of a genome from reads
of length L where L > k. Abstractly, each read of length L gives us L-k+1 strings
of length k (called k-mers). To quantify the number of reads necessary for this
to work, given a success probability $$(1-\epsilon)$$, we must characterize
the number of L length reads necessary to get the k-spectrum.

Reads of length L are said to  *k-cover* if there is a read starting in every
L-k+1 window of the genome. Note that this means that for every read, there exists
a second read with its
starting position within L-k+1 positions after the starting position of the
first genome. Note that a set of reads k-covering a genome implies that one
can recover the k-spectrum of the genome from the reads (Can you see why?).

Consider the following practical algorithm to assemble:

```
Sample reads enough to get k-coverage.  
Run the de Bruijn graph algorithm with the k-spectrum thus obtained.
```

Here we note  that k is a tradeoff parameter. For the algorithm to succeed we
need that k - 1 > $$\ell_{interleaved}$$, the length of the longest interleaved
repeat. Thus a larger k makes assembling more genomes possible; however, larger
values of k lead to smaller values of L-k+1. k coverage tells us that we need to get a read starting in
every L-k+1 window of the genome, so one would need to sample more reads.


Using similar calculations to those used in the last lecture, we get the following graph  describing the number
of reads necessary for an algorithm to succeed.

<div class="fig figcenter fighighlight">
  <img src="/Spr2016/assets/lecture8/Figure9.png" width="75%">
	<div class="figcaption">Lower bound from Lander-Waterman calculation, the read
	complexity necessary for the greedy algorithm and the
  de Bruijn algorithm to succeed (with probability \(1-\epsilon\)), and Bresler-Bresler-Tse's
	lower bound for successful assembly (with probability \(1-\epsilon\)).</div>
</div>

The curve for the de Bruijn algorithm is computed by setting $$k = \ell_{interleaved} + 1$$, thus it is the most optimistic performance achievable, since in reality the algorithm does not know $$\ell_{interleaved}$$ and has to be more conservative. We note that though the de Bruijn graph algorithm achieves the vertical asymptote,
it does need a  fairly large number of reads to do so.
Although greedy has a worse vertical asymptote, it is better for larger values of
L since it requires less reads.

The reason the de Bruijn curve does not match the Bresler-Bresler-Tse's lower bounds is
because it requires every $$\ell_{\text{interleaved}}$$-mer on the genome to be bridged  (Note
that k-coverage means every k-2 mer in the genome must be bridged. Why?) rather
than just having the interleaved repeat bridged. In the next lecture, we will see
a tweak of the de Bruijn graph algorithm that tackles this problem to achieve better
performance.
