You should copy and paste the code from the top cell into your notebook as you will use this to class to perform assembly. Note that you will need to pass a list of reads (strings) as the ```strIter``` argument when initializing an instance of the class (see ```__iter___```). You can use the ```eulerianWalkOrCycle``` method to obtain a list of $k-1$-mers corresponding to an Eulerian walk through the graph. Write a function that obtains the assembly from this list of $k-1$-mers (i.e. if the list is ['ABCD','BCDE'] with $k=5$, then your function should return 'ABCDE')."
